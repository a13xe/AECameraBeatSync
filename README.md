A simple AE script for dynamic camera movements synced to a specified BPM.

 ## :joystick: How to Use?
- open your composition in AE and make sure it has 3D layers enabled
- open ExtendScript and run [AECameraBeatSync](https://github.com/a13xe/AECameraBeatSync/blob/main/AECameraBeatSync.jsx) 
- it'll create an animated camera

## :memo: Prompts:
- BPM: Beats per minute
- start Frame: when the animation should begin
- transition duration: length of each movement in frames
- amplitude: camera movement intensity in pixels
- base drift range: random position variation range after each beat
